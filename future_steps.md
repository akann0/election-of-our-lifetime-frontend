We're so live

Plans for the future, as to make it an overall more enjoyable User Experience:

1) Change the color schemes so that they fit with the candidates (ie. blue things are blue, red things are red, etc)
2) Add more demographics.  The basic ones sure (urban-rural, race, gender, age, religous-atheist) but also funny demographics,
such as "people who sleep with their socks on", "divorced dads", "performative males", "astrologists" etc.
3) alongside 2 - make a cache of Vice Presidents, and then have some sort of logic to determine which president is which
4) some sort of "polls" that estimate our results before they fully load
5) some sort of News Coverage that parodies John King, Anderson Cooper, and other media figures as they give results
6) debate results? stump speech at the end? make up some sort of campaign issue (ie. cow campaigns on subsidies for chicken)
7) use an image gen (or web search) to give an image of these candidates

Also, gear towards making ai slop content for Tiktok, with the goal of having it as automated as possible
